# Human-Activity-Recognition-using-Smart-Phones
To understand different human activities, experiments have been conducted on 30 volunteers to measure 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz through the accelerometer and gyroscope embedded in the smartphone attached to their waist. Based on the features captured, six different activities were identified (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) and manually labelled. The dataset has already been divided into 70% training and 30% testing data. The aim of this project is to perform an unsupervised clustering algorithm, DBSCAN on the dataset to identify all the six activities of humans. Since it is an unsupervised algorithm, all the training and testing have been combined to perform the clustering. The project also involves applying dimensional reduction techniques and parameter tuning methods.
